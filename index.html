    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Internet, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies have transformed the way humans can interact with each other and express romance, sex, and other forms of intimacy. Digital intimacy, including online dating, sexual/intimate content sharing, online sex work, and romantic chatbots, has grown ubiquitous. This can both be a source of great joy, such as when connecting remote partners and supporting sexual self-expression, and a source of harms, including but not limited to image-based sexual abuse, deepfakes, location privacy violations, and technology-enabled intimate partner violence. As new technologies continue to transform digital intimacy, this workshop aims to create a sex-positive space for digital intimacy researchers as we imagine and build a world where everyone is able to safely engage in consensual intimate activities with dignity and agency.</p>

  <!-- Call for Participation Section -->
  <section id="call" class="container py-5">
    <h2>Call for Participation</h2>
    <p>As in most other facets of life, people have brought parts of their intimate and sexual relationships online. Research and design for digital sexual intimacy can support opportunities for stronger relationships, greater self-esteem, and sexual satisfaction. At the same time, new forms of digitally-mediated sexual abuse have arisen, driving a range of research on understanding, preventing, and remedying harms.</p>
    <p>While this area is growing rapidly, research across the spectrum of digital intimacy can be stigmatized and ethically challenging, making working in the space an isolating experience for many. Furthermore, as there are increasing moves to regulate technology used in perpetuating sexual violence, there is a need for researchers across disciplines to work cooperatively to form research agendas, define best practices for work in this space, and work towards joint recommendations for collective advocacy.</p>
    <p><strong>Workshop goal:</strong> This hybrid workshop brings together scholars and practitioners across disciplines to create community and share expertise on the challenges of building, researching, and regulating intimate technologies. The workshop is aimed at researchers who have already done some work in the field, as our goals include sharing research challenges and agenda-setting.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Participation:</strong> Please complete the survey linked below to indicate your interest and experience. This will require submitting your name, a short biography, why you would like to attend the workshop, and what you hope to get from attending.</li>
      <li><strong>Talk Submission:</strong> We are accepting submissions for lightning talks via the same form. Please include an abstract and a link to published work. For work-in-progress, submit an abstract and a 2-page paper in ACM format describing the content of a roughly 10-minute talk.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Responses will be reviewed by the workshop organizers. Upon acceptance, at least one author of each accepted talk must attend the workshop. The submissions will not be published—we will instead publish a list of talk abstracts and a summary of the workshop activities on our website. All participants must register for the workshop.</p>
    <p><strong>Submission Deadline: August 15</strong></p>
